# OSPFv3 Disguised LSA
Implementation of a Disguised LSA attack for OSPFv3.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rewbycraft/OSPFv3DisguisedLSA.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rewbycraft/OSPFv3DisguisedLSA)

## What is this?
The Disguised LSA attack for OSPF has been widely described. [1] [2] [3]
However, we were unable to find an example of someone performing this attack against the latest generation of OSPF, OSPFv3.
In principle there is no reason it shouldn't work, we're here to give it a try.

## Why would you do this?
We are a pair of students at the [TU/e](https://www.tue.nl/).
We are creating this for the project of the course 2IC80 Lab on Offensive Computer Security.
